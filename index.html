      "Respect for the conventions of language (morphology and syntax), the search for coherence in statements through the use of proper terms, the refusal to "say anything, any way as long as it is understood" are gestures of civilization that the media must nourish if they do not want to play the role of levelers of the masses."

      r. Dubuc, Head of the Linguistic and Translation Department of Radio-Canada in Montreal


      Some people easily complain about the "decline of language", about a decrease in the quality of style in the media. Certainly, the digital change is also accompanied by a fundamental revolution in the use of media at the expense of professional news media. This is accompanied by a growing preference for audiovisual platforms. Videos are rewarded with particularly high user response rates and are favored by the algorithms of technology intermediaries. The media have a large responsibility in the evolution of language since written and spoken media (TV and radio) produce a lot of language material. The goal of this project is to successfully classify quotes from American newspapers to determine their style. The database on which this analysis was conducted contains quotes from American politicians from 2015 to 2020. An analysis on the evolution of informal language use is difficult on such a short time step but if the method shows a good classification potential then the analysis could be conducted on a larger dataset. In addition to the temporal evolution, the identification of categories of politicians (age, gender, political affiliation) using informal language more frequently may also be useful to better characterize the phenomenon.
