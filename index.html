    Introduction

    <p>
      <center>"<i>Respect for the conventions of language (morphology and syntax), 
      the search for coherence in statements through the use of proper terms, 
      the refusal to "say anything, any way as long as it is understood" are gestures of civilization 
      that the media must nourish if they do not want to play the role of levelers of the masses.</i>"</center> <br><br>

      Some people easily complain about the "decline of language", about a decrease in the quality of style in the media. 
      Certainly, the digital change is also accompanied by a fundamental revolution in the use of media 
      at the expense of professional news media. This is accompanied by a growing preference for audiovisual platforms. 
      Videos are rewarded with particularly high user response rates and are favored by the algorithms of technology intermediaries. 
      The media have a large responsibility in the evolution of language since written and spoken media (TV and radio) 
      produce a lot of language material. The goal of this project is to successfully classify quotes from American newspapers to determine their style. 
      The database on which this analysis was conducted contains quotes from American politicians from 2015 to 2020 in news articles. 
      An analysis on the evolution of informal language use is difficult on such a short time step 
      but if the method shows a good classification potential then the analysis could be conducted on a larger dataset. 
      In addition to the temporal evolution, the identification of categories of politicians (age, gender, political affiliation) 
      using informal language more frequently may also be useful to better characterize the phenomenon.

    With which data ?
  </h1>
  
    <p>
    Quotebank is the main data source for this project.  It is derived from the work of the The Data Science Lab of EPFL in collaboration with Stanford University. 
    Quotebank is an open corpus of 178 million quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them. 
	    The data has been extracted from 162 million English-language news articles published between 2008 and 2020. 
	    To obtain a corpus of that scale the team of the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">DLAB</a> developped a minimally supervised framework for extracting and attributing quotations 
	    from massive corpora with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)" target="_blank">BERT-based model</a>. 
	    The full dataset is publicly available on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4277311" target="_blank">Zenodo</a> 
	    and a more detailed description of the methods used for quote extraction can be found in the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> of the research team 
	    of the EPFL laboratory (T. Vaucher, A. Spitz, M. Catasta, R. West 2021). 
	    This database will be used to extract quotes and analyze the linguistic quality of the different speakers, 
	    which makes it an interesting source of data to answer the use of language in the news articles.

    A lot of data, good ! Cleaned data, better !

    <p>
      Quotbank outputs are given with a prediction on one or many candidate speaker. 
	    Overall, Quobert correctly attributes 86.9% of quotations in our experiments but sometimes the outcome is quiet uncertain. 
	    The data output by the quotebank algorithm is of the following form:

	<p>Data wrangling is therefore necessary. The idea is not to keep all the quotes for the sake of uncertainty. The following deletion criteria have been applied:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>speaker is not identified or not clearly identified (p_1 < 0.5)</li>
	  <li>is potentially confused with another speaker (p_1-p_2 < 0.3)</li>
	</ul>
